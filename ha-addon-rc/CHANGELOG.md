## [Unreleased]

## [2.41.0-rc.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- New runtime telemetry and event hook surfaces: `/api/bridge/telemetry` exposes bridge/subprocess resource data, and `/api/hooks` lets operators register runtime-scoped webhooks with delivery history for internal bridge/device events.
- Device event normalization now captures recent Bluetooth/runtime/MA transitions more consistently, so diagnostics and health summaries can explain degraded and recovering devices from recent event history instead of only current flags.

### Changed
- ROADMAP Phase 1 and Phase 2 runtime foundation work is now live on `main`: route read paths are snapshot-first, device inventory is owned by the canonical `DeviceRegistry`, startup/shutdown publication is tightened around `BridgeOrchestrator`, and parent/daemon communication now uses explicit IPC envelopes.
- Config lifecycle handling is now schema-aware end-to-end across load/save/import/export/Home Assistant translation paths, with shared migration/write helpers and safer preservation of persisted MA credentials plus runtime state.
- Diagnostics, onboarding, and status-adjacent APIs now reuse normalized snapshot/telemetry surfaces more consistently instead of mixing direct raw-state reads with duplicated enrichment logic.

### Fixed
- `/api/diagnostics` no longer re-runs expensive environment/subprocess collection when embedding telemetry, reducing duplicate `ps`/subprocess probing on lower-power systems.
- Bug reports now redact persisted OAuth tokens and runtime-state fields using the shared sensitive-key policy, preventing newly added config secrets from leaking into generated reports.
- Runtime hook registration now rejects loopback/private/link-local targets and invalid non-numeric timeout payloads, closing SSRF-prone and 500-shaped failure paths.
- Persisted `LAST_SINKS` entries now normalize MAC keys consistently during write/load pruning, so cached Bluetooth sink mappings no longer disappear because of lowercase or whitespace-padded MAC keys.
- Device-event helper annotations now accept canonical `DeviceEventType` values directly, aligning typing with the runtime call sites used by Bluetooth and Music Assistant event publishers.

## [2.40.6-rc.7] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Music Assistant beta queue mode controls now work again for solo bridge players: `shuffle` / `repeat` treat MA `error_code` replies as real rejections and fall back from modern solo player ids to legacy `up...` queue ids when that is the actual queue target.
- Standalone Configuration now uses a shorter `Web UI port` helper so the port description fits on one line without wrapping.

## [2.40.6-rc.6] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Existing LXC installs can once again update onto the new prerelease tag-based channel flow: runtime update checking no longer imports `scripts.release_notes`, and the LXC install/upgrade snapshot sync now copies the `scripts/` directory so staged validations keep matching the real application tree.

## [2.40.6-rc.5] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Release engineering now treats GitHub Releases as a stable-only surface: prerelease update discovery switches to Git tags plus the tagged `CHANGELOG.md`, and Home Assistant add-on variant sync now runs directly on every stable/RC/beta tag push without depending on the manual GitHub release workflow.

### Fixed
- Music Assistant beta transport skip controls now prefer player-level `next` / `previous` commands for normal player IDs while keeping the legacy queue fallback, so solo-player skip actions work again against newer MA beta builds.
- Home Assistant add-on polish: the ingress port field is now clearly read-only/shaded, its helper copy is shorter, and clicking the signed-in username opens the profile in a normal new browser tab instead of a popup-style window.

## [2.40.6-rc.4] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- High-frequency bridge control routes and long-running Music Assistant/update actions now avoid blocking request threads: MA discovery/rediscovery, update checks, and queue commands use async job polling or optimistic completion flows instead of waiting synchronously in the Flask request path.
- Home Assistant add-on update track selection is now tied to the installed add-on slug, so the add-on options no longer expose `update_channel` switching and the bridge UI treats track/update guidance as read-only information.
- Home Assistant add-on mode now treats the web UI port as a fixed ingress property of the installed track and shows that port as read-only in Configuration, while leaving `base_listen_port` configurable for Sendspin player listeners.

### Fixed
- Password and backend log-level settings no longer report success when config persistence fails; runtime log-level propagation is only attempted after the config write succeeds.
- Login rate-limiting behind trusted Home Assistant ingress proxies now uses validated forwarded client identity instead of collapsing all users into the proxy IP bucket.
- Home Assistant add-on sessions now hide the logout button and route Music Assistant profile/group-settings links through add-on ingress instead of direct host/IP URLs.

## [2.40.6-rc.3] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- The local demo now defaults to a more realistic signed-in header state, showing a user/logout block plus a Music Assistant token notice so preview screenshots better reflect the intended top-bar layout and onboarding guidance.

### Fixed
- Hidden notice cards now stay truly hidden even when the shared notice layout applies `display: grid`, preventing duplicate Music Assistant notices from appearing in demo.
- The header utility area now includes a visible divider between the theme toggle and the user/logout controls, so the top-right actions read as distinct groups again.
- The update-available badge no longer reuses RC/beta channel tinting; prerelease text coloring remains on the current-version badge only.

## [2.40.6-rc.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Top-of-page warnings now use a shared stacked notice-card layout with consistent icon/title/body/CTA structure, so security and Music Assistant notices match the rest of the dashboard card system and stack cleanly on mobile.

### Fixed
- The Music Assistant warning notice no longer appears when the runtime bridge integration is already connected, even if the saved-token validation probe disagrees.
- Header action links in the top-right corner once again keep visible spacing between their icons and labels.
- The theme switcher's `Auto` icon now renders as a visible circled `A` instead of collapsing into a filled circle in the header button.

## [2.40.6-rc.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Home Assistant add-on ingress sessions can now try to obtain a long-lived Music Assistant token automatically when the UI opens, with a default-enabled opt-out toggle in Configuration → Music Assistant.
- The web UI now shows a warning banner when Music Assistant is discoverable but the bridge integration is still missing or using an invalid token, with a shortcut into the Music Assistant configuration section.

### Changed
- The theme switcher now has an explicit three-mode cycle (`Auto`, `Light`, `Dark`) instead of only manual light/dark toggling, and both the login page and the main dashboard now bootstrap the same saved theme mode consistently.

## [2.40.5-rc.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Home Assistant add-on config validation no longer treats optional manual `web_port` / `base_listen_port` overrides as required fields, because unset values are now omitted from addon defaults and Supervisor option sync payloads instead of being sent as `null`.

## [2.40.5-rc.2] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Bridge config, web UI, and Home Assistant addon options now support manual top-level `WEB_PORT` and `BASE_LISTEN_PORT` overrides. In Home Assistant addon mode, `WEB_PORT` opens an additional direct host-network listener while the fixed ingress endpoint keeps using the channel default port.

### Changed
- Home Assistant prerelease addon variants now combine distinct default ingress/player port ranges, manual startup defaults, channel-specific branding, and HA-safe prerelease notices so parallel stable/RC/beta installs are easier to distinguish and safer to run on one HAOS host.
- The GitHub release workflow now builds the release body from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section and uses GitHub-generated notes only as an optional supplement, preventing empty autogenerated releases.

### Fixed
- Music Assistant album artwork now loads correctly through Home Assistant ingress because artwork proxy URLs stay relative to the active addon origin instead of escaping to the Home Assistant root.
- Solo-player Music Assistant transport controls now keep working when Music Assistant syncgroup discovery is empty because queue commands respect an explicit solo queue ID instead of requiring `ma_groups` to be populated first.
- Header version/update indicators now tint only the RC/Beta version text instead of coloring the entire badge, and Home Assistant add-on info/docs now render prerelease notices correctly through HA-safe badge markdown.

## [2.40.5-rc.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Solo-player Music Assistant transport controls now keep working on live Proxmox/LXC deployments even when MA syncgroup discovery is empty, because queue commands now respect an explicit solo queue ID instead of requiring `ma_groups` to be populated first

### Changed
- Header version badges and discovered-update badges now highlight prerelease channels directly in the UI: RC builds use yellow styling and beta builds use red styling
