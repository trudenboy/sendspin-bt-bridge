# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.7] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Web UI redesigned** to match Home Assistant / Music Assistant visual language
  - CSS custom properties (`:root` design tokens) replace all hardcoded colors
  - `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` dark theme with HA dark palette
  - Header styled as HA app-toolbar (`--app-header-background-color`)
  - Primary color changed from purple (`#667eea`) to HA blue (`#03a9f4`)
  - Status/action colors mapped to `--success-color`, `--error-color`, `--warning-color`
  - Cards use `--ha-card-border-radius` (12px) and `--ha-card-box-shadow`
  - Buttons: `border-radius: 4px`, uppercase, HA letter-spacing and font-weight
  - Font changed to Roboto (Google Fonts) with `-apple-system` fallback
  - HA Ingress `setTheme` postMessage listener — live theme injection when opened in HA sidebar

## [1.3.6] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- HA addon runtime detection: `_detect_runtime()` now checks `/data/options.json` before falling through to `docker`, preventing `api_logs()` from trying to run `docker logs` inside the addon container
- Logs endpoint in HA addon mode now fetches from Supervisor API (`GET /addons/self/logs`) using `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`

## [1.3.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- All `fetch()` calls in the web UI now use `API_BASE` prefix — fixes JSON parse errors when accessed via HA Ingress (where the page URL contains a token path segment and bare `/api/...` resolved against HA Core instead of the addon)

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- `pipefail` crash in `entrypoint.sh`: `bluetoothctl show | head -10` caused `bluetoothctl` to receive SIGPIPE and exit non-zero under `set -euo pipefail`; suppressed with `|| true`

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- `entrypoint.sh` now detects HA addon mode via `/data/options.json` and translates it to `/config/config.json` before startup, matching the Docker Compose flow

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- New device default `static_delay_ms` changed from `-500` to `0`
- New devices added via the web UI now have their initial volume set to the current group volume slider value, restored on first service start

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Adapter change in config no longer causes "device not paired" reconnect loop on restart — `POST /api/config` now runs `bluetoothctl remove` for devices whose `adapter` field changed or that were deleted, cleaning up stale pairings from the old adapter before the service restarts

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Shell injection risk in `_run_bluetoothctl` — replaced string-formatted bash command with stdin pipe
- XSS vulnerability in web UI — HTML attribute positions now use `escHtmlAttr()` instead of `escHtml()`
- `monitor_output` task not cancelled when sendspin process restarts, causing duplicate log readers
- Signal handler used `asyncio.create_task` which could leave orphaned tasks on shutdown
- Per-player audio format cache was a module-level global, causing wrong format shown for second device in multi-device setups
- Removed dead code: `ClientHolder` class and `get_client_instance()` function
- LXC: `module-bluetooth-policy auto_switch=never` added to `pulse-system.pa` — fixes A2DP connection failure for devices that advertise HFP/HSP profiles (e.g. ENEBY Portable); SCO sockets required by HFP are unavailable in LXC kernel namespaces, causing `br-connection-unknown` disconnect before PulseAudio could create the A2DP sink

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Multi-device support** — bridge multiple Bluetooth speakers simultaneously, each appearing as a separate player in Music Assistant; configure via `BLUETOOTH_DEVICES` array in `config.json`
- **Home Assistant addon** (`ha-addon/`) — native HA addon with Ingress support; web UI appears directly in the HA sidebar
- **Proxmox LXC deployment** (`lxc/`) — fully headless deployment without Docker:
  - `lxc/proxmox-create.sh` — one-command LXC container creation on Proxmox host with Bluetooth D-Bus passthrough and system-mode PulseAudio
  - `lxc/install.sh` — in-container installer for dependencies and systemd units
  - `btctl` wrapper for Bluetooth control via host D-Bus socket
- **Multi-adapter support** — `adapter` field in device config pins a speaker to a specific Bluetooth controller (`hci0`, `hci1`, …)
- **Per-device latency compensation** — `static_delay_ms` field compensates for A2DP + PulseAudio buffer latency (default `-500ms`)
- **Per-device listen port/host** — `listen_port` and `listen_host` fields control per-player Sendspin daemon binding
- **Volume persistence per device** — volume saved per MAC address under `LAST_VOLUMES` in `config.json`, restored on reconnect
- **Group volume/mute controls** — control all players simultaneously from the web UI
- **Reconnect and Re-pair buttons** — per-device controls in the status dashboard
- **Bluetooth scan filtering** — scan results filtered to audio-capable devices only (by BT device class / A2DP UUID)
- **BT adapter management panel** — auto-detect adapters with manual override support
- **`/api/diagnostics` endpoint** — structured health info: adapters, sinks, D-Bus availability, per-device status
- **Audio format display** — codec, sample rate, and bit depth shown in device status cards (e.g. `flac 48000Hz/24-bit/2ch`)
- **Sync status tracking** — re-anchor count and last sync error shown in device cards
- **Timezone autocomplete** — IANA timezone list in configuration UI
- **Per-player WebSocket URL** — displayed in device cards for debugging

### Changed
- `BLUETOOTH_MAC` env var superseded by `BLUETOOTH_DEVICES` array (backward compatible — single MAC still supported)
- `SENDSPIN_NAME` used as player name prefix
- Device info reported to Music Assistant set to `Sendspin / Bluetooth Bridge`
- `PULSE_SINK` set per-process for isolated audio routing per device
- Audio route configured without changing system default sink (per-process via `PULSE_SINK`)
- Removed Player Name Prefix field from configuration UI

### Fixed
- Bluetooth disconnect detection reliability improvements
- `bluetooth_sink_name` not set when sendspin process restarts after unexpected death
- Volume/mute controls disabled when audio sink not yet configured
- Bluetooth `AF_BLUETOOTH` kernel namespace limitation in LXC resolved via host D-Bus bridge
- Playing status detection updated for actual sendspin log output format
- BT scan: stdin kept open so bluetoothctl has time to discover devices
- Volume sync: parse `Server set player volume` log format from Music Assistant
- `LAST_VOLUMES` preserved when saving configuration via web UI

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-27 (upstream: loryanstrant/Sendspin-client)

### Fixed
- Bluetooth connection status monitoring reliability
- Bluetooth disconnect detection with real-time status polling

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-01 (upstream: loryanstrant/Sendspin-client)

### Added
- Initial release: Dockerized Sendspin client with Bluetooth speaker management
- Flask web UI served by Waitress on port 8080
- Auto-reconnect to Bluetooth device every 10 seconds
- PipeWire and PulseAudio sink detection and routing
- Volume sync from Music Assistant to Bluetooth speaker via `pactl`
- mDNS auto-discovery for Music Assistant server (`SENDSPIN_SERVER=auto`)
- Config persistence via `/config/config.json`
